# ruby-rpg
A fast RPG Framework for Ruby using libgosu.

# Running examples
Clone the repository, and run some example from the main directory. Example: 

ruby example/example01.rb

# Considerations
I'm actually building a tutorial using a lot of actions to make more easy to understand the framework. Need help with YARD... If someone can help me, mail me: emanuelbotelho@ymail.com
